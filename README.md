## Introduction
This collection of tutorials are based from my learnings from client projects. I will talk about what each topic is, how to implement it and then we will see the value it has made on the website.

## Benefits

- You likely use it every day at work.
- This makes it possible to practice and apply your acquired knowledge each day on real world programs rather than pet projects.
- Be able to show clients the value of the improvement based on the results of each section.

## Testing platform

When testing on web page test run the tests at these settings to get simlliar results to mine.
